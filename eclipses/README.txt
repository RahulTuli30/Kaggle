Analysis and prediction based on the data for solar (and lunar) eclipses, as posted on https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/solar-eclipses/

The Jupyter notebook contains analysis of time between eclipses, and a prediction model, predicting the next eclipses based on the past data.

The Python file does the same as the notebook (up to minor differences). The data needs to be located in a subfolder ./data with respect to the Python script.
