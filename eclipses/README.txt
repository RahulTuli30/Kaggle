Analysis and prediction based on the data for solar (and lunar) eclipses, as posted on https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/solar-eclipses/

The Jupyter notebook contains analysis of time between eclipses, and a prediction model, predicting the next eclipses based on the past data. The final model uses an XGBoost Classifier, and obtains a eclipse prediction accuracy of ~3.6%.

The Python file does the same as the notebook (up to minor differences). The data needs to be located in a subfolder ./data with respect to the Python script.
